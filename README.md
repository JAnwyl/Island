Island
======
I Want to make a "Island" that will recieve control via bluetooth and a Playstation 3 wireless remote
it would then send those controls via Ethernet or XBee wireless to a recieving module

The thought/point is that I would have the buttons and future projects would allow control via the joysticks

I want to make a ROV and it would be nice to control the ROV via a joystick, it would also be nice to control a camera via another joystick.
Plus the buttons to control various functions.

I would like to control a RC car or truck, maybe have a camera mounted.

I would like to control a quadcopter.

I'm thinking a Island to recieve the bluetooth commands (Short range wireless) then relay them via XBee or Ethernet would be a good thing to have.
